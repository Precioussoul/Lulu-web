The Lulu game was developed and is managed by MyCom DAO. A DAO is an organization, designed to be automated and decentralized. It acts as a form of fund, based on open-source code and without an orthodox management structure or a board of directors.

To be fully decentralized, a DAO is unaffiliated with any particular nation-state, and it makes use of the Ethereum and other Layer 2 Blockchain networks. Structuring as a DAO eliminates human error or manipulation of funds by placing decision-making power into the hands of an automated system and a crowdsourced process.

Fueled by Ethereum through the Arbitrum Layer 2 chain, Our DAO is designed to allow investors to send money from anywhere in the world anonymously. The system then provides those owners tokens, allowing them voting rights on projects.

## How it works

Africa is largely underrepresented on the internet. With the aim of collecting language data and advancing the African identity online, we have created a platform where this can be achieved while also earning in the process and having fun.

We are introducing Cowry, a token which will be earned in the game upon completion of tasks and translations which users will be able to convert into crypto. Our mission with this is to make cryptocurrency easily available to the layman and onboard the African populace onto Web3. Lulu requires no capital or investment, all thatâ€™s needed is your knowledge of your native language.

Lulu assigns a wallet to users after an account has been created and this model makes it relatively easy for users to share tokens among themselves.
