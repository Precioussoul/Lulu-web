              <p>
                We know that children deserve extra privacy protection. That’s
                why we treat child users differently to ensure their parents are
                in control and we only collect the bare minimum information we
                need to make Lulu work. When a user creates a Lulu account we
                collect their age and compare it to the local standard of child
                online consent depending on the country they registered in. We
                refer to users under this age as “child users”. Child users are
                permitted to create a user account but we ask them to provide
                their parent’s email address instead of their own. We also
                prevent child users from supplying their own name because we
                don’t need that information. After registration we will send an
                email notifying the parent about MyCom DAO’s privacy and
                information practices regarding child users, including what
                personal data we collect and how we use, share, and protect that
                personal data. The email also explains how parents can request
                that MyCom DAO access, change or delete the personal data about
                their child.
