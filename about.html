            <p class="about-text">
              The Lulu game was developed and is managed by MyCom DAO. A DAO is
              an organization, designed to be automated and decentralized. It
              acts as a form of fund, based on open-source code and without an
              orthodox management structure or a board of directors.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              To be fully decentralized, a DAO is unaffiliated with any
              particular nation-state, and it makes use of the Ethereum and
              other Layer 2 Blockchain networks. Structuring as a DAO eliminates
              human error or manipulation of funds by placing decision-making
              power into the hands of an automated system and a crowdsourced
              process.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Fueled by Ethereum through the Arbitrum Layer 2 chain, Our DAO is
              designed to allow investors to send money from anywhere in the
              world anonymously. The system then provides those owners tokens,
              allowing them voting rights on projects.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              MyCom DAO started as a group of individuals from across Nigeria
              that believe in the essence of preserving our identity as Africa
              through common languages. DAO technology allows us to collectively
              take decisions on the company by raising proposals and voting on
              them. As a startup, we currently have seven members, two
              volunteers and one partner. Four vote holding members in the DAO.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Our members have different inter-related skills with two things in
              common, love for the development of Africa at heart and the belief
              that the basic infrastructure of the internet will be rebuilt on
              blockchains and decentralized systems.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              All African languages put together currently do not form 20% of
              all content on the internet, this means the more the internet
              takes hold of daily human life, the more African languages will be
              eroded with time. There’s no better time to secure our lingual
              identity on the internet than now.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              As enthusiasts of blockchain technology and the prospects it holds
              for development, we believe, incentivizing players of the Lulu
              Game will help onboard the average African on the concepts of
              blockchain and owning digital assets. MyCom DAO is of the school
              of thought that the concept of blockchain technology started in
              Africa and we can come to be a global leader with innovation on
              this technology.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              By introducing the most basic form of digital/cryptocurrency as a
              reward for contributing to populating African language data on the
              internet, the blockchain technology take over won’t be sudden and
              we could achieve widespread, early adoption.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              We dream of a day where our mothers can speak to Siri in Yoruba,
              swahili, twi or any African language and a time where the Average
              African holds and utilizes digital currency on a daily basis.

          <div class="how-it-work-wrapper">
            <h2 class="how-it-work-heading">How it works</h2>
            <p class="how-it-work-text">
              Africa is largely underrepresented on the internet. With the aim
              of collecting language data and advancing the African identity
              online, we have created a platform where this can be achieved
              while also earning in the process and having fun.
            </p>
            <p class="how-it-work-text">
              We are introducing Cowry, a token which will be earned in the game
              upon completion of tasks and translations which users will be able
              to convert into crypto. Our mission with this is to make
              cryptocurrency easily available to the layman and onboard the
              African populace onto Web3. Lulu requires no capital or
              investment, all that’s needed is your knowledge of your native
              language.
            </p>
            <p class="how-it-work-text">
              Lulu assigns a wallet to users after an account has been created
              and this model makes it relatively easy for users to share tokens
              among themselves.
