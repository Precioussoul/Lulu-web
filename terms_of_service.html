                Lulu websites (“Websites”), mobile applications (“Apps”) and
                related services (together with the Websites, the “Service”) are
                operated by MyCom DAO. (“MyCom DAO,” “us,” or “we”). Access and
                use of the Service is subject to the following Terms and
                Conditions of Service (“Terms and Conditions”). By accessing or
                using any part of the Service, you represent that you have read,
                understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions
                including any future modifications. MyCom DAO may amend, update
                or change these Terms and Conditions. If we do this, we will
                post a notice that we have made changes to these Terms and
                Conditions on the Websites for at least 7 days after the changes
                are posted and will indicate at the bottom of the Terms and
                Conditions the date these terms were last revised. Any revisions
                to these Terms and Conditions will become effective the earlier
                of (i) the end of such 7-day period or (ii) the first time you
                access or use the Service after such changes. If you do not
                agree to abide by these Terms and Conditions, you are not
                authorized to use, access or participate in the Service.

                grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive license to
                download, install, and use one copy of each App in object code
                form only on an interactive wireless device that you own or
                control. You may not derive or attempt to derive the source code
                of all or any portion of any App, permit any third party to
                derive or attempt to derive such source code, or reverse
                engineer, decompile, disassemble, or translate any App or any
                part thereof. MyCom DAO and its licensors own and shall retain
                all intellectual property rights and other rights in and to the
                Apps, and any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto.
                The following terms and conditions applyto you only if you are
                using the Apps from the Apple App Store. To the extent the other
                terms and conditions of these Terms and Conditions are less
                restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and
                conditions of this paragraph, the more restrictive or
                conflicting terms and conditions in this paragraph apply, but
                solely with respect to Apps from the Apple App Store. You
                acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions are solely
                between you and MyCom DAO, not Apple, and that Apple has no
                responsibility for the Apps or content thereof. Your use of any
                App must comply with the App Store Terms of Service. You
                acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish
                any maintenance and support services with respect to the Apps.
                In the event of any failure of any App to conform to any
                applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund
                the purchase price, if any, for the App to you; to the maximum
                extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other
                warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Apps, and any
                other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses
                attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be
                solely governed by these Terms and Conditions. You and MyCom DAO
                acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any
                claims of you or any third party relating to the Apps or your
                possession and/or use of any App, including, but not limited to:
                (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that an App fails
                to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement;
                and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar
                legislation. You and MyCom DAO acknowledge that, in the event of
                any third-party claim that any App or your possession and use of
                that App infringes that third party’s intellectual property
                rights, MyCom DAO, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the
                investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such
                intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required
                by these Terms and Conditions. You must comply with applicable
                third party terms of agreement when using any App. You and MyCom
                DAO acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries,
                are third party beneficiaries of these Terms and Conditions as
                they relate to your license of the Apps, and that, upon your
                acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, Apple will have the
                right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce
                these Terms and Conditions against you as a third party
                beneficiary thereof.

              <p>
                If you purchase an auto-renewing periodic subscription through
                the Service, your Lulu account will be billed continuously for
                the subscription until you terminate it as set forth below.
                After your initial subscription period, and again after any
                subsequent subscription period, your subscription will
                automatically renew for an additional equivalent period. If you
                do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you
                want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to
                log in to your Lulu account and follow instructions to terminate
                or change your subscription, even if you have deleted your
                account. In the Service, you may purchase, with “real world”
                money, a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,

                (b) “virtual in-app items” (together with “virtual currency,”

                through the Service, and not in any other way. MyCom DAO may
                manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at
                any time, with or without notice. MyCom DAO may update the
                pricing of Virtual Items at any time in its sole discretion, and
                may add new Virtual Items for additional fees. MyCom DAO shall
                have no liability to you or any third party in the event that
                MyCom DAO exercises any such rights. The transfer of Virtual
                Items is prohibited except where expressly authorized in the
                Service. Other than as expressly authorized in the Service, you
                shall not sell, redeem or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to
                any person or entity, including but not limited to Company,
                another user, or any third party. You agree to pay all fees and
                applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using a Lulu account

                goods and services offered through the Service at any time. All

                conflict of law provisions of that or any other jurisdiction,
                regardless of your country of origin or where you access the
                Service. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS
                AND CONDITIONS OR THE SERVICE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING
                ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except for MyCom DAO’s right
                to seek injunctive relief as set forth below. Unless otherwise
                expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its
                own attorneys’ fees without regard to which party is deemed the
                prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding. If you do not
                want to arbitrate disputes with MyCom DAO and you are an
                individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by
                sending an email to mycommunitydao@gmail.com within 30 days of
                the day you first access or use the Service. If you intend to
                seek arbitration you must first send written notice to MyCom
                DAO’s Administration Office of your intent to arbitrate
                (“Notice”). <br />
                The Notice to MyCom DAO should be sent by any of the following
                means: (i) electronic mail to mycommunitydao@gmail.com. The
                Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
                dispute; and (y) set forth the specific relief sought; and (z)
                set forth your name, address and contact information. If we
                intend to seek arbitration against you, we will send any notice
                of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.
                The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single
                arbitrator in the County of Allegheny in the Commonwealth of
                Pennsylvania, whose decision will be final and binding, and the
                arbitral proceedings will be governed by JAMS under its
                Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS
                Rules”) as modified by these Terms and Conditions. The JAMS
                Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com. All issues are for the
                arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration
                clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms
                and Conditions. <br />
                If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be
                limited to the filing fee set forth in the JAMS Rules. We will
                reimburse all other JAMS filing, administration and arbitrator
                fees paid by you, unless the arbitrator determines that the
                arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, in
                which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the
                JAMS Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in the English
                language. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may
                be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any claim
                where the potential award is reasonably likely to be $10,000 or
                less, either you or MyCom DAO may elect to have the dispute
                resolved through non-appearance-based arbitration. <br />
                To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, YOU AND MYCOM
                DAO EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE
                CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS,
                CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If for any reason a claim
                proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, YOU AND MYCOM DAO
                EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. If a court of competent
                jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid
                or inapplicable, you and MyCom DAO agree that all claims arising
                out of or related to these Terms and Conditions must be resolved
                exclusively by a state or federal court located in the County of
                Allegheny in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and you and MyCom
                DAO each agree to submit to the exercise of personal
                jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all
                such claims. Notwithstanding the above, you agree that MyCom DAO
                shall still be allowed to apply for and obtain injunctive
                remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any
                jurisdiction.
